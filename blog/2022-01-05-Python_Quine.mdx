# Python Quine

A quine is a computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.

I first read about this kind of program in the ACM article [Reflections on Trusting Trust (August 1984 Volume 27 Number 8 Page 761)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf).

Here is my solution

import { ClickToReveal } from '../src/components/ClickToReveal/ClickToReveal.js';

<ClickToReveal
    language="python" 
    text="print('print({}.format({}))'.format('print({}.format({}))'))" />
