# Useless Machine - Lego Technic

The purpose of a Useless Machine is to turn itself off when activated. Built examples and kits and  exist online. While researching I found Lego models but not kits or instructions.

Challenge accepted!

I completed the model in March 2017.

Without a parts list or instructions I decided to reverse engineer the device from the following video:

I created a model using Lego Digital Designer before buying the parts. [Download the LXF model](./UselessMachine.lxf)

I generated a PDF with building instructions and a parts list at the end using LDD.
