        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of a Useless Machine is to turn itself off when activated. Kits and built examples are available for purchase. While researching I found LEGO models but without kits or instructions.</p><p>Challenge accepted!</p><p>I completed the model in March of 2017 and revised it today.</p><p>Without a parts list or instructions I decided to reverse engineer the device from the following video:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAk-rhvZe2w">[011] Lego Technic - Useless Machine</a></p><p>I created a model using LEGO Digital Designer (LDD) before buying the parts. <a href="./UselessMachine.lxf">Download the LXF model</a></p><p>Using LDD I generated a PDF with building instructions and a parts list at the end.
<a href="./UselessMachineInstructions.pdf">Download the PDF instructions</a></p><p>Here is the model at the final step of assembly</p><p><img src="./Step84.png" alt="Final Step from instructions"/></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past single hand clocks and watches were common, but they were difficult to read precisely. Minute hands were added to address the precision problem.</p><p>An alternative approach to improving precision with a single hand is to digitally zoom the clock face.</p><h2>The Math</h2><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Definitions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Viewport</td><td>window on circular clock</td></tr><tr><td><code>R</code></td><td>viewport radius</td></tr><tr><td>Clock face</td><td>the numbers and tick markings as a group</td></tr><tr><td><code>tau</code></td><td>angle of hour hand from pole (3 o&#x27;clock)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Zooming the clock face means choosing a clock face segment to enlarge. The clock face segment has a chord.</p><p>Let <code>alpha</code> be half the clock face segment angle.</p><p>Zooming is done by scaling the chord to be the viewport diameter.</p><p>Let <code>r</code> be half the chord length, then <code>sin(alpha) = r/R</code>. The scaling factor is <code>R/r = 1/sin(alpha)</code>.</p><p>Let <code>d</code> be the distance from viewport center to chord midpoint before scaling, <code>d = R * cos(alpha)</code>.</p><p>The translation offset in x- and y-direction before scaling are</p><ul><li><code>dx = cos(tau) * d = R * cos(tau) * cos(alpha)</code></li><li><code>dy = sin(tau) * d = R * sin(tau) * cos(alpha)</code></li></ul><p>After scaling</p><ul><li><code>dx&#x27; = R * cos(tau) * cos(alpha) / sin(alpha)</code></li><li><code>dy&#x27; = R * sin(tau) * cos(alpha) / sin(alpha)</code></li></ul><p><code>alpha</code> has interval <code>(0, pi/2]</code>. The left bound is open because <code>alpha = 0</code> means infinite zoom which is not useful to display.</p><p>To avoid the infinite zoom problem we introduce a zoom variable <code>z</code> and a function <code>f: [0, inf) -&gt; [pi/2, 0)</code> that approaches 0 asymptotically.</p><p>The most obvious such function is <code>f(z) = 1 / (z + 2/pi)</code>. An additional advantage of asymptotically approaching 0 is course adjustments at low zoom and fine adjustments at high zoom.</p><p><code>[0, inf)</code> is not practical for input because of <code>inf</code> so it is best to close the right bound. Naturally, the output interval right bound should also be closed at an arbitrary value. One such choice is <code>[0, 100] -&gt; [pi/2, pi/6]</code>. The most obvious such function is <code>g(z) = 1 / (k*z + 2/pi)</code> where the reader can find <code>k</code> as an exercise.</p>]]></content>
