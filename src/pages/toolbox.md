## Docker: "bash" into a docker container
I often need to inspect docker images.  The following is the command to do this and a break down of the options.

```
docker run -it --rm IMAGE_NAME /bin/bash
```
-i, --interactive Keep STDIN open even if not attached 
-t, --tty Allocate a pseudo-TTY
--rm Automatically remove the container when it exits

## GitLab CI: Split long commands... there's a bug

At time of writing (29 Nov 2022) GitLab CI has an embarrassing bug. Certain script failures are not reported. Failures in script files are also not reported unless it's the last command in the script.

> If multiple commands are combined into one command string, only the last commandâ€™s failure or success is reported. Failures from earlier commands are ignored due to a bug. To work around this, run each command as a separate script item, or add an exit 1 command to each command string.

## Ruby Gems: execute specific version from several installed
Multiple versions of a Ruby Gem can be installed for use from the command line. For example to see which versions of bundler you have 

```
gem list bundler
```

To use the version you want put the version number between underscores right after the gem command line name (note this may be different than the gem name).

```
bundle _2.3.4_ install
```

## GitHub: Find repos you own in an Organization

It is impossible on the GitHub website to see a list of repos in an Organization that you own.

Here is a GraphQL query (with query variables) that gets you pretty close. You still have to manually filter repos forked from an Organization repo. The `login` values in the response can help select the org you care about. You can run the query on https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer. Don't forget to sign in.

```
query pagination($first: Int!, $after: String = null) {
    viewer {
        repositories(first: $first, after: $after, affiliations: [ORGANIZATION_MEMBER]) {
            totalCount
            nodes {
                name, url
                owner { login }
            }
            pageInfo {
                startCursor, endCursor
                hasPreviousPage, hasNextPage
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here is the REST api version:  

```
curl \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  -u "$USERNAME:$PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/user/repos?affiliation=organization_member&per_page=100&page=1
```
