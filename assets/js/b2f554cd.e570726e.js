The internet is complicated and the GitHub writers are trying to make the docs helpful even for beginners.\\n\\nThe long and short of it is that the steps (for apex domain with https and www) are in the docs [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain). Unfortunately the DNS instructions are confusing.\\n\\nHere are the steps I had to follow:\\n\\n- Enter your desired custom domain in the repo settings page (**before** creating any DNS entries)\\n\\n   I used fidelcoria.com (without the leading `www.`)\\n\\n   Doing this will configure a CNAME file on your GitHub Pages branch\\n\\n- Create an ALIAS record via your DNS provider\\n\\n  The docs say \\"`To create an ALIAS or ANAME record, point your apex domain to the default domain for your site`\\".\\n\\n  The `apex domain` did not work. Instead I had to use `@`, which is used to represent the \\"bare domain\\" in DNS records.\\n  \\n  ```\\n  ALIAS\\n  Host: @\\n  Target: alzafacon.github.io.\\n  ``` \\n\\n- Create a CNAME record via your DNS provider\\n  \\n  The docs say \\"`Navigate to your DNS provider and create a CNAME record that points www.example.com to the default domain for your site`\\"\\n\\n  `www.fidelcoria.com` did not work. Instead I had to use `www`.\\n  ```\\n  CNAME\\n  Host: www\\n  Target: alzafacon.github.io.\\n  ```\\n\\nDNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate. This makes it hard to tell if something is wrong or just needs more time.\\n\\nI learned the best approach for me was to get informed, decide what I want, make a plan, try it out, observe patiently, then iterate.\\n\\n## Extra DNS setup\\n\\nI also setup alzafacon.com to redirect to fidelcoria.com\\n\\n```\\nURL Redirect\\nHost: @\\nDestination URL: https://fidelcoria.com\\nUnmasked\\n```"},{"id":"/2021/12/05/DigiLog","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/12/05/DigiLog","editUrl":"https://github.com/alzafacon/alzafacon.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/blog/2021-12-05-DigiLog/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-05-DigiLog/index.mdx","title":"DigiLog: Digital Zoom for a Single Hand Analog Timepiece","description":"Clocks and watches originally had a single hand so the minutes were hard to read.

Thus the minute hand was introduced.\\n\\nAnother way to read the minutes with a single hand is by zooming into the section of the clock where the hour hand points to the time. For example, at 6:30 the tick marks will show the hour hand to be half way between 6 and 7. While at 7:05 you can zoom in to see the tick marks showing 5 minutes past 7.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Math\\n\\n| | Definitions |\\n| - | - |\\n| Viewport   | circular window of fixed size |\\n| `D` | viewport diameter\\n| `R`        | viewport radius |\\n| Clock face | the numbers, tick markings, and the hour hand together |\\n| `r` | distance between viewport center and midpoint of chord to be zoomed (chord offset) |\\n| `tau` | time \\"angle\\" in radians of hour hand from polar axis (3 o\'clock) |\\n| `a` | length of the chord |\\n| `S` | scale factor |\\n\\n<img \\n  alt=\\"chord diagram\\"\\n  className=\\"fix-img-fuzziness\\"\\n  src={require(\\"./ChordDiagram_1000.gif\\").default}\\n  style={{display: \'block\', margin: \'auto\', padding: \'10px\'}}\\n  />\\n\\n> SOURCE: Weisstein, Eric W. \\"Chord.\\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Chord.html\\n\\nZooming the clock face is simply done by enlarging a circular segment centered where the hour hand is pointing. In the image above the time would be 1:30.\\n\\nI take the chord and enlarge it to be congruent with the view port diameter. So to scale the chord from `a` to `D` the whole clock face must be scaled by `D/a` (i.e. `a(D/a) = D`). \\n\\nThe chord is determined when the user chooses `r`. We need an expression for the value of `a` given `r`.\\n\\nEasy! Pythagorean theorem: \\n\\n    R^2 = r^2 + (a/2)^2\\n    a/2 = sqrt(R^2 - r^2)\\n     a  = 2sqrt(R^2 - r^2)\\n\\nSo now we have the scale factor:\\n\\n    S = D/a \\n      = 2R / (2sqrt(R^2 - r^2))\\n      = R / sqrt(R^2 - r^2)\\n\\nNext we need to slide the midpoint of the chord onto the center of the viewport.\\n\\nIt might help to think of the midpoint in polar coordinates as (`Sr`, `tau`). Yes, I scaled by S. With a simple change of coordinates we have:\\n\\n    dx = Sr cos(tau)\\n    dy = Sr sin(tau)\\n\\nimport { FreestyleClock } from \'../../src/components/clock/FreestyleClock.js\';\\n\\n<div style={{margin: \'auto\', width: \'50%\'}}>\\n  <FreestyleClock />\\n</div>\\n\\n## Course and Fine adjustment of r\\n\\nUsing a slider to change `r` linearly is a bad user experience. At low zoom the clock face moves very little and at high zoom the clock face moves too much. If you graph the scale function It is easy to see why this happens. `S(r)` grows quickly and is also concave up.\\n\\nIt would be better for the value of r to change more quickly at low zoom (course adjustment) and more slowly at high zoom (fine adjustment).\\n\\nThis can be done by letting the user input a zoom value rather than let them input `r` directly. Now we can map the zoom value any way we want with a function `f(z) = r`.\\n\\nI would like to take `z` to be in `[0,1]` and `f(1) = p`, where `0 < p < 1` and `pR` is the max chord-offset allowed. `f` should be monotonically increasing, concave down, with an inflection point somewhere around 0.1, and preferably asymptotic to `1`. Notice `f` will be multiplied by `R` to give the final chord offset.\\n\\nA good candidate function is `1 - 1/(z + 1)`.\\n\\nSo I\'ll start applying transformations to get the desired properties.\\n\\n    f(1) = p = 1 - 1/(kz + 1)\\n    ... algebra ...\\n    k = p / (1-p)\\n    \\n    f(z) = 1 - 1/(pz/(1-p) + 1)\\n           ... algebra ...\\n         = 1 - (1-p)/(pz + 1 - p)\\n           ... algebra ...\\n         = pz / (pz + 1 - p)\\n\\nFinally to get the actual chord offset we take `Rf(z)`. \\n\\nThat\'s all folks!"}]}')}}]);
