The water level will not change!\\n\\nWait a minute! How do we know that `The mass of the displaced volume of water\\nmust be equal to the mass of the ice causing that water to be displaced.`?\\nWell, picture this: gravity is applying to a body of water. Pushing against the\\nwater causes an equal-magnitude and opposite-direction reaction. The more water\\nis displaced the greater reaction force. You are pushing against gravity!\\n\\nThis is the buoyancy force!\\n\\nThe force an object can exert due to gravity on a body of water is determined by\\nits mass. That object will sink if the force exerted by the object is greater\\nthan the buoyant force. In other words: if the mass of the object is greater\\nthan the mass of the object\'s volume in water then the object sinks. \\n\\nIf the mass of an object is less than the mass of the object\'s volume in \\nwater... then the object sinks.\\n\\nIn other words, objects denser than water sink, objects less dense than water\\nfloat.\\n\\n## Back to saltwater\\n\\nIn the previous discussion the medium of floatation was the same as the object\\nof displacement. In other words: ice (frozen h20) is floating in water (liquid \\nh20).

Obviously, this made it hard to tell time accurately. Until the minute hand was invented.\\n\\nI came up with another way to read the minutes without a minute hand. Since the position of the hour hand past the hour marking implies the minutes... zooming into the hour hand shows minutes at a better resolution. For example, at 6:30 the tick marks will show the hour hand to be half way between 6 and 7. While at 7:05 you can zoom in to see the tick marks showing 5 minutes past 7.\\n\\nimport { FreestyleClock } from \'../../src/components/clock/FreestyleClock.js\';\\n\\n<div style={{margin: \'auto\', width: \'50%\'}}>\\n  <FreestyleClock />\\n</div>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Math\\n\\n| | Definitions |\\n| - | - |\\n| Viewport   | circular window of fixed size |\\n| `D` | viewport diameter\\n| `R`        | viewport radius |\\n| Clock face | the numbers, tick markings, and the hour hand together |\\n| `r` | distance between viewport center and midpoint of chord to be zoomed (chord offset) |\\n| `tau` | time \\"angle\\" in radians of hour hand from polar axis (3 o\'clock) |\\n| `a` | length of the chord |\\n| `S` | scale factor |\\n\\n<img \\n  alt=\\"chord diagram\\"\\n  className=\\"fix-img-fuzziness\\"\\n  src={require(\\"./ChordDiagram_1000.gif\\").default}\\n  style={{display: \'block\', margin: \'auto\', padding: \'10px\'}}\\n  />\\n\\n> SOURCE: Weisstein, Eric W. \\"Chord.\\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Chord.html\\n\\nZooming the clock face is simply done by enlarging a circular segment centered where the hour hand is pointing. In the image above the time would be 1:30.\\n\\nI take the chord and enlarge it to be congruent with the view port diameter. So to scale the chord from `a` to `D` the whole clock face must be scaled by `D/a` (i.e. `a(D/a) = D`). \\n\\nThe chord is determined when the user chooses `r`. We need an expression for the value of `a` given `r`.\\n\\nEasy! Pythagorean theorem: \\n\\n    R^2 = r^2 + (a/2)^2\\n    a/2 = sqrt(R^2 - r^2)\\n     a  = 2sqrt(R^2 - r^2)\\n\\nSo now we have the scale factor:\\n\\n    S = D/a \\n      = 2R / (2sqrt(R^2 - r^2))\\n      = R / sqrt(R^2 - r^2)\\n\\nNext we need to slide the midpoint of the chord onto the center of the viewport.\\n\\nIt might help to think of the midpoint in polar coordinates as (`Sr`, `tau`). Yes, I scaled by S. With a simple change of coordinates we have:\\n\\n    dx = Sr cos(tau)\\n    dy = Sr sin(tau)\\n\\n## Course and Fine adjustment of r\\n\\nUsing a slider to change `r` linearly is a bad user experience. At low zoom the clock face moves very little and at high zoom the clock face moves too much. If you graph the scale function It is easy to see why this happens. `S(r)` grows quickly and is also concave up.\\n\\nIt would be better for the value of r to change more quickly at low zoom (course adjustment) and more slowly at high zoom (fine adjustment).\\n\\nThis can be done by letting the user input a zoom value rather than let them input `r` directly. Now we can map the zoom value any way we want with a function `f(z) = r`.\\n\\nI would like to take `z` to be in `[0,1]` and `f(1) = p`, where `0 < p < 1` and `pR` is the max chord-offset allowed. `f` should be monotonically increasing, concave down, with an inflection point somewhere around 0.1, and preferably asymptotic to `1`. Notice `f` will be multiplied by `R` to give the final chord offset.\\n\\nA good candidate function is `1 - 1/(z + 1)`.\\n\\nSo I\'ll start applying transformations to get the desired properties.\\n\\n    f(1) = p = 1 - 1/(kz + 1)\\n    ... algebra ...\\n    k = p / (1-p)\\n    \\n    f(z) = 1 - 1/(pz/(1-p) + 1)\\n           ... algebra ...\\n         = 1 - (1-p)/(pz + 1 - p)\\n           ... algebra ...\\n         = pz / (pz + 1 - p)\\n\\nFinally to get the actual chord offset we take `Rf(z)`. \\n\\nThat\'s all folks!"}]}')}}]);
