Minute hands were added to address the precision problem.\\n\\nAn alternative approach to improving precision with a single hand is to digitally zoom the clock face.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Math\\n\\nDefinitions\\nViewport: window on circular clock\\n`R`: viewport radius\\nClock face: the number and tick markings as a group\\n`tau`: angle of hour hand from pole (on a polar graph)\\n\\nZooming the clock face means choosing a clock face segment to enlarge. The clock face segment has a chord.\\nLet `alpha` be half the clock face segment angle.\\nZooming is done by scaling the chord to be the viewport diameter.\\nLet `r` be half the chord length, then `sin(alpha) = r/R`. The scaling factor is `R/r = 1/sin(alpha)`.\\nLet `d` be the distance from viewport center to chord midpoint before scaling, `d = R * cos(alpha)`.\\nThe translation offset in x- and y-direction before scaling are\\n  `dx = cos(tau) * d = R * cos(tau) * cos(alpha)`\\n  `dy = sin(tau) * d = R * sin(tau) * cos(alpha)`\\n\\nAfter scaling\\n  `dx\' = R * cos(tau) * cos(alpha) / sin(alpha)`\\n  `dy\' = R * sin(tau) * cos(alpha) / sin(alpha)`\\n\\n`alpha` has interval `(0, pi/2]`. The left bound is open because `alpha = 0` means infinite zoom which is not useful to display.\\nTo avoid the infinite zoom problem we introduce a zoom variable `z` and a function `f: [0, inf) -> [pi/2, 0)` that approaches 0 asymptotically.\\nThe most obvious such function is `f(z) = 1 / (z + 2/pi)`. An additional advantage of asymptotically approaching 0 is course adjustments at low zoom and fine adjustments at high zoom.\\n\\n`[0, inf)` is not practical for input because of `inf` so it is best to close the right bound. Naturally, the output interval right bound should also be closed at an arbitrary value. One such choice is `[0, 100] -> [pi/2, pi/6]`. The most obvious such function is `g(z) = 1 / (k*z + 2/pi)` where the reader can find `k` as an exercise."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/alzafacon/alzafacon.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Docusaurus blogging features are powered by the blog plugin.","date":"2021-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 26, 2021","tags":[{"label":"facebook","permalink":"/blog/tags/facebook"},{"label":"hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0.405,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Fidel Coria","title":"Programmer","url":"https://fidelcoria.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/alzafacon.png","key":"alzafacon"}],"prevItem":{"title":"DigiLog - The Single Hand Analog Clock with a Digital Enhancement","permalink":"/blog/2021/12/05/DigiLog"}},"content":"[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog).\\n\\nSimply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.\\n\\nRegular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.\\n\\nThe blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:\\n\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`\\n\\nA blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)\\n\\nThe blog supports tags as well!\\n\\n**And if you don\'t want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config."}]}')}}]);
